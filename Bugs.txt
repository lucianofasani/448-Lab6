\f0\fs24 \cf0 isEmpty(): Seems to work when size is 0, but as soon as values are added this function still returns empty.\
\
size(): Works as intended.\
\
addFront(value): Adds to the front and increments size.\
\
addBack(value): Adds value but not to the back of the list. Adds value to the front of the list instead. Increments size correctly.\
\
search(value): Works correctly. Finds the value that exists in the list, returns false when you make it search a value that does not exist in the array\
\
removeFront(): Does not work at all. Values still exist in list, and size is not decremented. May depend on isEmpty(), which coincidentally is broken as well.\
\
removeBack(): Same issue as removeFront(). Doesn\'92t remove the value from anywhere and size is not decremented.}
